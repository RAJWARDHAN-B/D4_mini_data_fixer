# D4_mini_data_fixer
In this assignment, you will simulate a lightweight agentic system—where independent “agents” handle different tasks in cleaning and enriching a dataset. Each agent should operate as a separate function or module with a clear role, and agents should pass work to each other to achieve a complete self-fixing pipeline.
